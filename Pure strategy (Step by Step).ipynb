The superscript represents the action taken by the player (c or nc). Each column of matrix $\\underset{\\sim}{S}$ refers to a single player and each row is a different strategy. \n",

    "4) The payoff matrix ($\\underset{\\sim}{U}$) follows the same rules as the matrix $\\underset{\\sim}{S}$. Each 'i' column represents the set of possible payoffs for player 'i'. Each row represents the set of payoffs for the 'n' players who have chosen a specific strategy. Below is an example of a utility matrix: \n",
